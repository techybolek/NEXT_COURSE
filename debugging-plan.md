# Edit Post Form Population Debugging Plan

## Current Behavior
- Form loads but fields are not populated with existing post data
- Post data is being loaded via the loader function
- Form has defaultValue props set correctly

## Investigation Steps

1. **Verify Loader Data**
   - Add console.log in loader to verify the structure of returned data
   - Check if the data includes all required fields (id, author, body)
   - Verify the data is being returned in the expected format

2. **Check Component Data Flow**
   - Add console.log for the post data from useLoaderData() in the component
   - Verify that the data is available when the component renders
   - Check if there's any transformation happening between loader and component

3. **Form Field Binding**
   - Verify the field names match the data properties
   - Check if defaultValue is the correct prop to use (vs value)
   - Consider if controlled components might be more appropriate

4. **Implementation Steps After Investigation**
   - Log findings from steps 1-3
   - Implement necessary fixes based on investigation
   - Add error boundaries if needed
   - Add proper error handling for missing or malformed data

## Next Actions
1. Add logging statements to track data flow
2. Run the application and trigger edit functionality
3. Analyze logs to identify where data flow breaks
4. Implement fixes based on findings
